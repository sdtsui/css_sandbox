CSS Definitions:

*CSS Framework* - Set of CSS Classes that make page layout easy to implement.

*Adaptive design* -  changing layout to make it easier to use for mobile/table.

*Responsive design* - simply changing the size.
  - example: using % instead of pixels


Grid Basics:
  - Most sites use 2, 3, or 4 columns for content
  - A basic layout could therefore be 12 columns, so accomodate all

Principle: Everything is Boxes: 

Shapes: 
Todo:
  Box to
  Circle : border-radius
  Triangle:
  Octagon:
  Hexagon:
  Rhombus

Tackling a New Design: 
  Split it up piece by piece into nested boxes.
  "big boxes to small with *pencil*"

________________________________
from demo1:

Margin vs Padding:
Padding does not overlap:
  - can get complicated to account for multiple elements with margins
Margin overlaps: 
  - only ensures spacing around its own box
